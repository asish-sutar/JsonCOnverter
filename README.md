# JSON Converter Utility

This Java utility, `JsonConverter`, facilitates the transformation of a JSON file into a customized JSON structure. It reads a given JSON file, extracts specific fields, and creates a new JSON structure based on predefined criteria.

## Overview

The `JsonConverter` is designed to perform the following operations:

- Reads an input JSON file (`set3.json`).
- Extracts specific fields from the input JSON.
- Constructs a new JSON structure with customized fields and configurations.
- Outputs the generated JSON to the console in a readable and structured format.

## Usage

1. **Input File:** Place the input JSON file `set3.json` in the designated location or configure the path within the code.

2. **Execute:** Run the `main()` method in `JsonConverter.java`.

3. **Output:** The utility generates a new JSON structure based on the provided criteria, displaying it in the console output.

In c variable, a is post increamented and b is pre incremented. when a is post increamented the value of a is 5 but in memory it is 6. ++b means b is increamented to 8 so the value of a is 5 and b is 8 . So sum of a and b is 13.",

## Dependencies

- This utility uses the Jackson library for JSON processing.

## Code Structure

The code mainly consists of a single Java class, `JsonConverter`. It contains the `main()` method responsible for reading, processing, and generating the new JSON structure.

## Instructions

- Ensure the Jackson library is included in the classpath for successful execution.
- Customize the extraction and construction logic based on specific requirements by modifying the code within the `main()` method.
